\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\par This work was made possible by financial support from Science and Technology Facility Council (STFC) and the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS).
\par I would like to express sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Diego Altamirano.  Without his experience, incredible patience and willingness to push me to improve myself, this work would not have been possible.
\par I would like to thank Professor Tomaso Belloni, Professor Ranjeev Misra and Dr Andrea Sanna for hosting me at their respective institutes at various times in my studies.  I also thank Professor Rudy Wijnands, Dr. Mayukh Pahari, Dr. Nathalie Degenaar and Professor Kazutaka Yamaoka for their contributions to our extensive collaborations.
\par I would like to thank my family for their unwavering support during this at-times arduous task.  I also thank my friends and colleagues at the university of Southampton, in particular Mr. David Williams and Dr. Aarran Shaw, who have all in some way helped me to survive to the end of this process; whether they realise it or not.
