\par\noindent I have created a two new sets of classifications for variability in IGR J17091 (Chapter \ref{ch:IGR}) and the Bursting Pulsar (Chapter \ref{ch:BPbig}).  In doing so, I have discovered previously unreported bursting behaviour in the late stages of outbursts of the Bursting Pulsar, and I have identified similarities between this behaviour and variability seen in Transitional Millisecond Pulsars (Chapter \ref{ch:BPletter}).  I have also created a number of algorithms to identify bursts or flares, and to 'fold' datasets which show repeating variability which the frequency is not constant (Chapter \ref{ch:methods}), and my own suite of computational tools to analyse X-ray event data (Appendix \ref{app:PAN}). xxxxx IGR backwards loop because evolves quicker than information is propagated to corona?  i.e. Neilsen picture
